# Face-Mask-Detection-Madkour
The novel COVID-19 virus has forced us all to rethink how we live our everyday lives while keeping ourselves and others safe. Face masks have emerged as a simple and effective strategy for reducing the virusâ€™s threat. Therefore, the goal of the project is to develop face mask detector using deep learning to use it in my company to know the violator and impose even a simple penalty.

# Dependencies
Deep Learning based Face-Mask-Detector architecture uses OpenCV (opencv==4.2.0) and Python (python==3.7). The model Convolution Neural Network(CNN) uses Keras (keras==2.3.1) on Tensorflow (tensorflow>=1.15.2). For face detection in images it uses caffe based model. Also, imutils==0.5.3, numpy==1.18.2, matplotlib==3.2.1, argparse==1.1 are also used.
